#  AgriLeaf Vision – Rice Leaf Disease Detection using Machine Learning

AgriLeaf Vision leverages **cutting-edge machine learning** to revolutionize agricultural diagnostics.  
Our project focuses on **precise and early detection of rice leaf diseases** to help farmers safeguard crop yield, reduce losses, and promote sustainable farming practices.

## Overview

Rice is one of the world’s most important staple crops — yet it’s vulnerable to multiple diseases that can devastate production.  
**AgriLeaf Vision** provides an **AI-driven solution** that can automatically detect and classify rice leaf diseases from images using advanced **deep learning models**.

### Key Objectives
- Automate rice leaf disease detection with high accuracy.  
- Assist farmers and agronomists with fast, accessible crop health diagnostics.  
- Contribute to the development of **AI-powered smart agriculture** systems.

## Workflow

1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**  
   - Image resizing, normalization, and augmentation.  
2. **Model Development**  
   - Trained a **CNN-based model** to classify rice leaf diseases.  
3. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics used.  
4. **Deployment (Future Scope)**  
   - Plan to deploy as a web or mobile app for farmer-friendly usage.

### DATA SUMMARY
This dataset contains 120 jpg images of disease infected rice leaves. The images are grouped into 3 classes based on the type of disease. There are 40 images in each class.

### Classes

* Leaf smut
* Brown spot
* Bacterial leaf blight

### LODING DATA / PREPARING DATA
•	Make a subset of data into three parts train, test, and validation with the help of split folder library.

### DATA PROCESSING
•	In this step generate the batches of training and validation and pre-process the images

### PLOTTING TRAINING IMAGES:

### MODEL BUILDING

* In this step we create CNN model architecture in that three types of layers convolution layer, pooling layer, 
And fully connected layer are added.
* Plotting a graphical representation of model
*	Get the summary of model
*	Compile model
*	Then the last train the model 
*	After training validation accuracy is 91.67% and accuracy is 84.38%.
*	Save the model

### MODEL EVALUATION:
•	Here the loss is 0.53 and the accuracy of model is 0.9166 means 91.66%

### MODEL TESTING:
In this step we are create a function to test multiple images from test data.

## Future Enhancements

- Real-time detection using a **mobile app or camera feed**  
- Integration with **IoT-based crop monitoring systems**  
- Expand model for **multi-crop disease detection**
